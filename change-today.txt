feat: implement guest authentication flow for cart actions

Integrate GuestAuthProvider into the root layout to enable guest session management.
Update ApiInterceptors to fallback to GUEST_TOKEN_KEY when a standard user token is not present.
Refactor ProductActions and ShopProductCard to use requireAuth from useGuestAuthFlow, gating "Add to Cart" functionality behind an authentication check (guest or login).
Add 22.32.245.79 to allowed image domains in next.config.ts.
